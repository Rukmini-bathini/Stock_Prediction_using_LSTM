# Stock_Prediction_using_LSTM
In this project, I have predicted the stock using LSTM (Long short term Memory) Networks for Microsoft Stock data. 
#Overview:
This repository contains a Python project that demonstrates stock price prediction using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The project utilizes historical stock price data to train an LSTM model for predicting future stock prices. The predicted prices are then compared with actual prices to evaluate the model's performance.
#Features
Data preprocessing: Loading and preprocessing historical stock price data.
LSTM model creation: Building and configuring an LSTM model for stock price prediction.
Model training: Training the LSTM model on historical data.
Predictions: Generating stock price predictions using the trained model.
Evaluation: Comparing actual and predicted prices, calculating performance metrics (Root Mean Squared Error), and visualizing results
#Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
1. data: Contains historical stock price data in CSV format.
2. notebooks: Jupyter notebooks for step-by-step data preprocessing, model creation, and evaluation.
3. 'README.md': Project overview, instructions, and usage guide.
